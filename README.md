Police incident report visualization for San Francisco Police Department dataset.

`This project was created as a homework assignment.`  

This project lacks additional README files, as default npm start/build/other commands should be sufficient for local development and hosting.

[A sample release is available here](https://liveearth-dawson-homework.netlify.app/).
